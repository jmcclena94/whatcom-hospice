    <h3 text-center>What is advance care planning?</h3>
    <p>
        Advance care planning is for all adults 18 and older. It is talking about future health care decisions if you had a sudden event, like a serious accident or illness, and could not make your own decisions. A person close to you would need to make choices for you. This person is called a health care agent or attorney in fact.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is important to write down your goals, values, and preferences using the following documents or documents like them. These documents, called advanced directives, should be updated regularly and shared with your health care agent, loved ones, physician, and hospital. You may complete one or both of these documents.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Health Care Agent - Durable Power of Attourney for Health Care.</strong>  Choose a health care agent to make medical decisions for you if you cannot make them for yourself.</li>
        <li><strong>My Wishes for Medical Treatment â€“ Health Care Directive.</strong>  Describe your personal values and goals for treatment, and choose whether you want life-sustaining treatments in certain situations.  This information can guide your health care agent and health care providers to make the best possible decisions on your behalf if you cannot make decisions for yourself in the future.</li>
